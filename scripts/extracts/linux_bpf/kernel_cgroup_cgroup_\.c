/**
 * css_next_descendant_pre - find the next descendant for pre-order walk
 * @pos: the current position (%NULL to initiate traversal)
 * @root: css whose descendants to walk
 *
 * To be used by css_for_each_descendant_pre().  Find the next descendant
 * to visit for pre-order traversal of @root's descendants.  @root is
 * included in the iteration and the first node to be visited.
 *
 * While this function requires cgroup_mutex or RCU read locking, it
 * doesn't require the whole traversal to be contained in a single critical
 * section. Additionally, it isn't necessary to hold onto a reference to @pos.
 * This function will return the correct next descendant as long as both @pos
 * and @root are accessible and @pos is a descendant of @root.
 *
 * If a subsystem synchronizes ->css_online() and the start of iteration, a
 * css which finished ->css_online() is guaranteed to be visible in the
 * future iterations and will stay visible until the last reference is put.
 * A css which hasn't finished ->css_online() or already finished
 * ->css_offline() may show up during traversal.  It's each subsystem's
 * responsibility to synchronize against on/offlining.
